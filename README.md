# Nema17-Sheetmetal-Motor-Mounts-CoreXY-
I developed a high-performance sheet-metal motor mount specifically for NEMA17 stepper motors in CoreXY 3D printers. The design delivers maximum rigidity to minimize deformation and significantly improves precision compared to typical 3D-printed mounts. Its aluminum surface enhances thermal performance by enabling effective heat dissipation and acting as a thermal buffer. The mount is engineered as a compact assembly for straightforward, cost-efficient manufacturing, combining precision, durability, and practicality.

Usermod based on Sergei Irbis DuEnder Project (https://www.printables.com/model/1174545-duender-2x-creality-ender-3-corexy-convertion)

Objectives for development of this sheetmetal part are:
- increase rigidty
- decrease
- cost effective manufacturing
- no CNC machines needed (e.g. opportunity to manufacture in your garage)
