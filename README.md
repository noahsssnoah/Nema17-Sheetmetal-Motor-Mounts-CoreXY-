# Nema17-Sheetmetal-Motor-Mounts-CoreXY-
A rigid sheet-metal motor mount for NEMA17 motors in CoreXY printers. Its large aluminum surface improves convective cooling and acts as a thermal buffer, spreading heat evenly. The design offers high stiffness, low deformation, and easy, cost-efficient manufacturing. UserMod for/based on DuEnder by Sergei Irbis.

Usermod based on Sergei Irbis DuEnder Project (https://www.printables.com/model/1174545-duender-2x-creality-ender-3-corexy-convertion)

Objectives for development of this sheetmetal part are:
- increase rigidty
- decrease
- cost effective manufacturing
- no CNC machines needed (e.g. opportunity to manufacture in your garage)
