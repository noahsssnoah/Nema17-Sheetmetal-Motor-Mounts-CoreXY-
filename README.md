# Nema17-Sheetmetal-Motor-Mounts-CoreXY-
I developed a high-performance sheet-metal motor mount specifically for NEMA17 stepper motors in CoreXY 3D printers. The design delivers maximum rigidity to minimize deformation and significantly improves precision compared to typical 3D-printed mounts. Its aluminum surface enhances thermal performance by enabling effective heat dissipation and acting as a thermal buffer. The mount is engineered as a compact assembly for straightforward, cost-efficient manufacturing, combining precision, durability, and practicality.

Objectives for development of this sheetmetal part are:
- increased version compatibility [V-Slot-Wheels-Version; MGN9H-Rail-Version; MGN12H-Rail-Version]
- designed for Nema17x60mm works also with shorter models of Nema17 Steppers
- cost-efficient manufacturing
  - sheetmetal design
    - excellent material utilization
  - no CNC operated systems needed (but possible via third-party-manufacturers)
- optimized thermal specs
  - 200x better thermal conductivity
    - motor heat gets dissipated through sheetmetal mount
    - motormount offers more surface to dissipate heat through convection and radiation
  - lower heat capacity
- increased rigidty
  - 20x better rigitdy/Youngs Modulus
  - deviation in the hundredths to tenth mm range
- designed to work with idlers instead of flange bearing to prevent belts from slipping/drifting
